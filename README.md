# Extension VS Code (optional)

A Visual Studio code extension that I have written is available in 'VsCodeExtension' folder.

It is not mandatory and is used only to add an option in VScode to create simultaneously the Test file with the Production Code file.

To install : Click on 'Extensions' (left panel), then click on '...' on the top of the 'Extension' panel and 'Install from VSIX'.

To use : Right click on a folder and 'Add new TDD Files', then enter the class name.
